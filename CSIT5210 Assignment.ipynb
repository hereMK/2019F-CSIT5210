    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will have an opportunity to apply some data mining techniques that you learned in the class to a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started on this assignment, you need to download the given dataset and read the description carefully written on this page. Please note that all implementation of your program should be done with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to form a team with at most 4 students. You and your groupmates should evenly divide the project tasks yourself. All team members are going to graded with the same score.\n",

    "There are two parts in this assignment. Part 1 is a programming exercise that your groups are required to complete certain tasks using Python. You should complete your Part 1 in this jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) directly. Part 2 is a group presentation that you need to present your findings on the Task 5 of Part 1.\n",
